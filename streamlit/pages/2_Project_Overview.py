Human curiosity has been rewarded by evolution, driving us to pursue knowledge with a continuous pursuit for advancement. We continually separate the information we acquire throughout the course of our exploration into compartments that are more or less closely connected in order to arrange it.
 
If our small minds, for some convenience, divide this universe, into
partsâ€”physics, biology, geology, astronomy, psychology, and so on remember that nature does not know it!
            
â€”Richard Feynman
 
The educational system has compelled us to specialise in a certain field of expertise because of the enormous amount of knowledge that has been acquired throughout the years. However, the idea of having a global perspective is discounted by the concept that the only way to contribute to society is to possess incredibly in-depth knowledge of a certain topic.
While it's true that diving deep into a subject helps us advance, it's also true that broadening our perspective will help us in our areas of expertise. In order to assist us comprehend the world in which we live, it is crucial that we are able to apply and relate concepts and ideas from various fields.
As a result, in each circumstance or event, we will not only be able to perceive things through our own limited lenses, but also, hopefully, with the benefit of our understanding of the most brilliant scientific theories.
 
And this pursuit of creating a global vision is the only vision of Nerdyfoxx.
